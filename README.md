# Masterming_HighSchool

## Introduction
This project was proposed during my computer classes in high school. We had to reproduce the Mastermind game with the python language we had just discovered with the Tkinter tool.

## Rules
The aim of the Mastermind game is for the computer to work out a combination that is difficult to decipher and for its opponent to guess this combination in a minimum of moves. The computer chooses a combination of 4 different colors and the player must find it with the help of clues.
